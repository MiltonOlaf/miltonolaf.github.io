### **Hi, i’m Milton.**

I´m a computer engineer and software developer who enjoys working on highly complex applications especially with Python, also an AI enthusiast, interested in ML engineering and meta-learning.

Right now working as a lead developer for [hiperable](https://hiperable.com) and building "[hyperplatform](https://hyperplatform.io). 

I should mention that I love open-source, I work on my small contribution before continuing my steps in the academy so I am open to collaborate on exciting projects, let me know if you need free help.

You can find me on twitter and github, or reach me via hey[at]miltonolaf.com.
