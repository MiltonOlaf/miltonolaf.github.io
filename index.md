# **Hi, i'm Milton.**

I'm a software engineer who enjoys working on complex applications especially with Python, also an AI enthusiast, interested in ML engineering and low-shot learning.

Right now working at Cornershop by Uber and building [hyplatform](https://hyplatform.io). 

I should mention that I love open-source, I work on my small contribution, so I'm open to collaborate on exciting projects, let me know if you need free help.

You can find me on [twitter](//twitter.com/olafmilton) and [github](//github.com/miltonolaf), or reach me via <a>hey[at]miltonolaf.com</a>.
