# **Hi, i'm Milton.**

I'm a computer engineer and software developer who enjoys working on highly complex applications especially with Python, also an AI enthusiast, interested in ML engineering and low-shot learning.

Right now working as a lead developer for [hiperable](https://hiperable.com) and building [hyplatform](https://hyplatform.io). 

I should mention that I love open-source, I work on my small contribution before continuing my steps in the academy so I'm open to collaborate on exciting projects, let me know if you need free help.

You can find me on [twitter](//twitter.com/olafmilton) and [github](//github.com/miltonolaf), or reach me via <a>hey[at]miltonolaf.com</a>.
